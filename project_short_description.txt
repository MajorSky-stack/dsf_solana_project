Machine-learning model built to predict the priority fee needed to reach the 0.9-quantile position in Solana blocks for the ORCA SOL–USDC liquidity pool.
The goal is to estimate the optimal fee that places a transaction early in the block without overpaying—crucial for short-lived arbitrage opportunities.

The project uses a dataset of 100,000 Solana blocks extracted from Snowflake, enriched with 40 engineered features such as cross-pool price differentials,
liquidity depth, congestion metrics, and seasonality derived from over 80 million historical blocks, as well as lagged quantile fees.
All features were constructed from raw blockchain data using a 700-line SQL query built from scratch. The preprocessing workflow separated skewed
and non-skewed variables, applying log + robust scaling to highly skewed features and Yeo–Johnson transformation to the rest.

Models tested include Ridge, ElasticNet, Random Forest, and a Neural Network. Best performance reached an MAE of ~3,470 lamports,
with cross-pool price differencials, liquidity depth, block congestion and lagged quantile fees emerging as the strongest predictors.
